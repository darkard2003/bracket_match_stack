# BracketMatch
A rudimentary code to check if all the brackets are balenced in a file

## Purpose
The whole purpose of this code is to learn the application of stack.

## Workings
1. Iterate through every charecter and keep track of line
2. If it's a opening bracket push it into the stack
3. If it's a closing bracket pop one element of the stack and check if the current closing bracket matches the stack top's closing bracket
4. If yes then continue
5. If not then print the bracket is mismatch and print the line number.
